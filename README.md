# Quiz Game Project

## Overview

The **Quiz Game** is a simple Python-based command-line quiz application that tests the user's knowledge with a series of multiple-choice questions. It provides input validation, handles null answers, and shows feedback based on the user's performance. The game is designed to be fun and easy to use.

### Key Features:
- **Multiple-Choice Questions**: A list of questions with three options to choose from.
- **Input Validation**: Validates if the user enters a valid number corresponding to the options.
- **Null Answer Handling**: If the user provides no answer (presses Enter without input), it is handled as a null answer.
- **Feedback**: Based on the user's score, feedback is given, ranging from "Excellent!" to "Better luck next time."
- **Shuffling**: Questions are shuffled randomly to ensure a fresh experience with each play.

- **Python 3.x** (Python 3.6 or later recommended)
